# About FAB
- id: about_fab
  translation: "I was born in Noumea, New Caledonia. 
  I studied IT at university in France and Canada. 
  After a few years of work in New Caledonia, 
  I decided to become a full-time traveller and 
  started my new journey by cycling across New Zealand, 
  where I met Mina.
  Besides travelling, 
  I enjoy playing retro video games 
  (that inspired me for this website design), 
  strumming my ukulele and practising various outdoor activities. 
  Also, I'm vegetarian so I hope I'll be able to provide good advice 
  for my fellow veggie mates.

# About MINA
- id: about_mina
  translation: "I was born in Tokyo, Japan. 
  After graduating from University as an architecture student, 
  I worked at a local atelier in Kyoto. 
  At the same time, I became a café barista as a hobby. 
  I quit my settled life to become a nomad. 
  I had never imagined to marry someone until I met Fab during my bikepacking trip. 
  I have visited over 60 countries so far...
  Swimming in nature is one of my favourite activities. 
  Otherwise I really enjoy chilling and eating. 
  That's why I think being the stoker on a semi-recumbent tandem bicycle is the perfect fit!

# About FAB AND MINA
- id: about_fab_mina
  translation: "We are a couple that made travelling their lifestyle. 
  We met in New Zeland and have visited a few countries together since then. 
  We mainly use slow means of transportation. 
  It makes our trips more fun and interesting.
  We are curious and adventurous, but what we enjoy the most is trying new food!"
